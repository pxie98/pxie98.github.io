<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Pengcheng Xie is a postdoctoral scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States, working with <a href="https://wildsm.github.io/">Division Director Stefan M. Wild</a>. His research focuses on computational mathematics, mathematical optimization, machine learning, and numerical analysis. He earned his PhD from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he was advised by <a href="https://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~yyx/">Prof. Ya-xiang Yuan</a>. 
Pengcheng has published in leading journals including SIAM Journal on Optimization, IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Journal of Computational Mathematics, Journal of the Operations Research Society of China, Chinese Annals of Mathematics, and American Control Conference. He has also organized or presented at major international conferences such as SIAM CSE 2025, SIAM NCC 2024, ISMP 2024, ICIAM 2023, and CSIAM 2022. 
His academic honors and recognitions include the SIAM-NCC Early Career Travel Award (2024), the Hua Loo-keng Prize<i>Scholarship (2019–2024), the CAS AMSS President Prize</i>Scholarship (2023), financial support from ICIAM (2023), and the Gold Award at the China Southeast Mathematical Olympiad. He was also a Meritorious Winner in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (2017) as a team leader. 
Beyond his research, Pengcheng has been active in professional service. He is a member of SIAM and MOS (since 2019), organized the minisymposium on Advances in Derivative-Free Optimization for Computational Science and Engineering at SIAM CSE25, and serves as editor and referee for Applied and Computational Mathematics (2024–2027). He has also reviewed for Mathematical Programming Computation, IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis, Optimization, Journal of the Operations Research Society of China, and several other journals and conferences. He served as President of the CAS SIAM Student Chapter (2021–2022), and is the founding Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Zhufeng (Fundamental Science), supported by the Ministry of Education of China since 2018. In addition, he has led multiple mathematical modeling and machine learning teams since 2016.</p>
