    abstract = {One particular class of derivative-free optimization algorithms is trust-region algorithms based on quadratic models given by the under-determined interpolation. Different techniques in updating the quadratic model from iteration to iteration will give different interpolation models. We propose a new way to update the quadratic model by minimizing the \$H^\{2\}\$ norm of the difference between neighboring quadratic models. The motivation for applying the \$H^\{2\}\$ norm is given. The theoretical properties of our new updating technique are also presented. We propose the projection in the sense of \$H^\{2\}\$ norm and the interpolation error analysis of our model function. We obtain the coefficients of the quadratic model function using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. Numerical results show the advantages of our model on the test set considered, and the derivative-free algorithms based on our least \$H^\{2\}\$ norm updating quadratic model functions can solve test problems with fewer function evaluations than the algorithm based on the least Frobenius norm updating model and the other compared methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a maintenance plan for the Kariba Dam in Africa. The Kariba Dam, a double curvature concrete arch dam in Zambia's capital, is crucial for regional energy and water management. Ensuring its safety and functionality is essential. This study provides a comprehensive analysis and maintenance plan to safeguard the dam's long-term viability. Our mathematical analysis begins with a threshold evaluation of three proposed options, considering costs such as relocation, dam removal, construction of new dams, repairs, and ecological damage, as well as benefits like energy generation, flood prevention, employment, tourism, and ecological protection. The data-driven analysis indicates that our option is the most economically viable. We assess water management capabilities, using them as a safety coefficient for the dams. We selected 30 seed points along the riverbank to establish dams. Our recommendation is to increase the number of dams and ensure their strategic distribution. An assessment model based on the analytic hierarchy process was then developed, focusing on three factors: safety, economy, and population. We determined the weights of each factor. The optimal scheme was identified through this model, and the sensitivity of the results was also evaluated. The greatest impact under extreme conditions was found. This paper provides the details of the theoretical analysis and the numerical experiments, which include the use of modeling, optimization, mathematical programming, and so on.},
